# 👋 Hi, I'm Tim 

I am a malaria modeler with the **Malaria Atlas Project**. My work focuses on using statistical and modeling tools to generate actionable insights for understanding malaria burden. I aim to inform evidence-based intervention strategies and vector control policies to combat malaria globally.  

## 🌟 What I’m Passionate About  
- **Statistical Insights**: Leveraging data to provide clear and reliable estimates of malaria burden.  
- **Intervention Strategies**: Translating data into actionable policies for effective malaria control.  
- **Vector Control**: Studying and modeling the impact of interventions on malaria transmission.  

## 📚 Current Projects  
- Supporting the Malaria Atlas Project's goal of mapping and modeling malaria prevalence and incidence.
